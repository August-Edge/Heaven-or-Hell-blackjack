# Blackjack Java Project
## How to play
This project is a blackjack game with a few twists.
Can you make it into heaven? Or will you end up in gambling hell!

Start the game by running main. 
You will then be met with a menu screen. Press 'S' to start the game.

You will start with 500 in your Saldo. Here you will choose the amount you want to bet for the following round.
Press the arrow UP key to increase the betting amount by 5 or press the arrow DOWN key to decrease the betting amount by 5.
If youre feeling lucky you can press 'A' to go all inn. This wil make the betting amount equal to the available saldo.
When you have found the right amount to bet you can press 'F' to continue.

After pressing 'F' the blackjack round will start. You will gain to cards and the dealer will also gain 2 card where one of the two remains hidden. Here you have three options. Press 'Space' to hit. This will give you another card. Press 'Enter' to Stand. This will end your round and start the dealers round. Do this if youre satisfied with your cards. Lastly you can double down. This is only possible if you have enough money left on your saldo. This will double your bet and draw one last card before starting the dealers round.

If you loose you loose the amount bet. If you win you get 2X the amount bet. If youre extra lucky and get an instant blackjack the payout is 3X. 

The Goal of the game is to get into heaven which in this twisted world is something that can be acheived by paying 3000.  This can only be done if you still have your soul and enough money on your saldo. This will end the game and leave you with stunning music and visuals.

If you loose some money (Specifically under 200 on saldo) there will pop up an offer to make a deal with the "Devil." 
If you choose to press 'S' to accept the deal youn will gain 1000 money to your saldo at the cost of your soul. This will place you in "Hell". 

To get out of hell you will need to earn back enough money to pay back your soul. This costs 1500 money. Once you have the money you can press 'B' to get your soul back. This will give you back your soul and send you back to the normal stage.

If you end up loosing all your money while youre in hell you will loose the game. This triggers the therapy sesh/ reality check that might be needed after such a wild gambling run.

If at any time you feel unsure of what buttons to press the active controls will be visible on screen with text that tells you what buttons to press to perform their actions.
